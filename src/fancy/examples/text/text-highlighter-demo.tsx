              correct spaces between letters and words and the length and
              spacing of lines conducive to easy reading, does much to enhance

              A typical characteristic of these forms of composition is the too
              narrow setting of the letters which makes reading difficult. The

              letters when ordering photo-typesetting.

              few of these have gained acceptance.{" "}

              undoubtedly produce a clean draft design that is almost ready for
              press. But a feeling for good letter forms and an attractive
              typeface can be acquired only by constant and careful practice in
              sketching letters.
