Fancy Components is a collection of fun and weird, ready-to-use components and microinteractions built (mainly) with:

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Motion (Formerly Framer Motion)

## Why

The web UI landscape has become increasingly standardized. While this standardization has brought many benefits — improved accessibility, better user experiences, and easier development — it has also led to a certain homogeneity. The web, in many ways, has become a bit... boring.

The aim of this project is to somewhat inject some playfulness to the web, by collecting the weird, fun, and sometimes useless ui magic that you can see in the wild.

Now you might ask, then why create a copy-and-paste-able collection of components? The goal here is to re-create the most popular components from the award-winning sites, so you can either use them in your project by adding your spin on top of them, or just to provide the code as an inspiration for creating your own components.

## Getting Started

## Open Source & Free

Fancy Components is open source and free to use. You can use it for personal or commercial projects.

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. A detailed contribution guide will be available soon.
