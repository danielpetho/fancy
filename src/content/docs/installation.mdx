The components are built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and mainly with Motion (Formerly Framer Motion).
In order to use the components, you need to install the following dependencies:

<CodeBlockWrapper className="mt-4" language="bash">{`npm install tailwindcss@latest framer-motion`}</CodeBlockWrapper>

Or follow the [Tailwind CSS installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to setup Tailwind CSS in your project.

Some components uses other libraries too, in each case, you can find the installation instructions in the component's documentation.

## Importing

Go to any of the components you want to use and copy the code from the "Installation" section. Then, paste it into your project.

## Example

<CodeBlockWrapper language="tsx">
{`
import { LetterSwapForward } from "@/fancy/components/text/letter-swap-forward-anim";

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex justify-center items-center">
      <LetterSwapForward label="Hover me!" reverse={true} className="italic" />
    </div>
  );
}`}

</CodeBlockWrapper>

## Notes

If you prefer javascript instead of typescript, you can easily convert the code with a tool like [this](https://transform.tools/typescript-to-javascript).
