The components are built with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and mainly with Motion (formerly Framer Motion).
In order to use the components, you need to install the following dependencies:

<InstallTabs command="tailwindcss@latest motion" />

Or follow the [Tailwind CSS installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to setup Tailwind CSS in your project.

Some components uses other libraries too, in each case, you can find the installation instructions in the component's documentation.

## Adding a component

You have two options to add a component to your project:

1. Using the CLI
2. Manually

### Using the CLI

To add a component using the CLI, you need to run the following command in your terminal:

<InstallTabs command="shadcn@latest add &quot;https://fancycomponents.dev/r/component-name.json&quot;" npx />

This will add the component source code and its dependencies in your project. You can then import the component in your code and start using it. 

**Important note:** as of now, additional dependencies aren't installed automatically, they just get added to the `package.json` file. You need to run `npm install` or the equivalent command in your preferred package manager to install them.

The appropriate link is available in the "Installation" section of each component's documentation page.

### Manually

Go to any of the components you want to use and copy the source code(s) from the "Installation" section. Make sure to update your imports accordingly. 

## Notes

If you prefer javascript instead of typescript, you can easily convert the code with a tool like [this](https://transform.tools/typescript-to-javascript).
