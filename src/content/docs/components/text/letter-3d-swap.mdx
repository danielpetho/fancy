## Usage

Just wrap your text with the component and set the `rotateDirection` prop to the direction you want the text to rotate, the rest will be taken care by the component.

## Understanding the component

### Splitting the text into characters

First, we split the text into `WorldObject` objects, each containing an array of characters and a boolean indicating whether there should be a space after the character. We use a handy function for this, which should respect emojis too.
<CodeSnippet title="Splitting the text into characters">
```tsx
// handy function to split text into characters with support for unicode and emojis
const splitIntoCharacters = (text: string): string[] => {
  if (typeof Intl !== "undefined" && "Segmenter" in Intl) {
    const segmenter = new Intl.Segmenter("en", { granularity: "grapheme" })
    return Array.from(segmenter.segment(text), ({ segment }) => segment)
  }
  // Fallback for browsers that don't support Intl.Segmenter
  return Array.from(text)
}
```
</CodeSnippet>

This method also helps us to ensure that words stay together and properly spaced when the text wraps across multiple lines. Without this approach, simply splitting by characters would break words at line boundaries.

<CodeSnippet title="Splitting the text into animation segments">
```tsx
// Splitting the text into animation segments
const characters = useMemo(() => {
    const t = text.split(" ")
    const result = t.map((word: string, i: number) => ({
      characters: splitIntoCharacters(word),
      needsSpace: i !== t.length - 1,
    }))
    return result
}, [text])
```
</CodeSnippet>

### 3D Transforms

When rendering each character, we create two instances of it - a front face and a second face. The second face is positioned relative to the first one and uses 3D CSS transforms to create the illusion that it's on a different face of a 3D box. The face it appears on depends on the `rotateDirection` prop:

- `"top"` - Character appears to flip upward from the top face
- `"right"` - Character appears to flip from the right side 
- `"bottom"` - Character appears to flip downward from the bottom face
- `"left"` - Character appears to flip from the left side


#### Top and bottom rotations

For top and bottom rotations, we create a 3D box effect through a series of transforms:

1. The front face is brought forward by translating it `0.5lh` on the Z axis (`lh` represents one line height)
2. For the second face, we:
   - Rotate it 90° (or -90°) on the X axis
   - Then translate it `0.5lh` forward in its local coordinate system to align with the edge of our virtual box
3. Finally, we translate the container back by `-0.5lh` to account for the initial translation of the front face

This creates the illusion of characters flipping between two faces of a 3D cube. The demo below shows how these transforms work together:

<ExplanationDemo name='letter-3d-swap-explanation-top-demo' />

#### Left and right rotations

For left/right rotations, we need to handle the box dimensions more carefully. Unlike top/bottom rotations where we can use line height (`lh`) as a fixed measurement, the width of each character varies. The side faces of our 3D box need to match the actual character width.

To achieve this, we use percentage-based translations on the X and Y axes, since these can automatically adapt to each character's width. The transform sequence works like this:

1. First face:
   - Rotate 90° on Y axis to face sideways
   - Translate 50% of character width to align with edge
   - Rotate -90° on Y axis to face forward again
   
2. Second face:
   - Apply the same transforms as the first face
   - Add additional transforms to position it correctly on the side

3. Lastly, we push back both faces to account for the initial translation

The demo below shows this transform sequence step by step:

<ExplanationDemo name='letter-3d-swap-explanation-left-demo' />

#### Why the initial translation?

The initial forward translation of our box (using `0.5lh` for `top`/`bottom` rotations, or the transform chain for `left`/`right` rotations) serves an important purpose. It ensures the rotation axis passes through the center of our virtual 3D box, rather than along its front face. This creates a more natural flipping motion, as the character rotates around its center point rather than pivoting from its front edge. Without this translation, the box rotation would appear to swing outward in an unnatural arc rather than flipping in place.

Of course, you can achieve the same result by applying (other) transforms in a different order, and even playing with the transform origins. I apologise if this seems overcomplicated, this is how it made sense to me :).

### Animation

Now that we have our virtual 3D box, the only thing left is to rotate each character box. For this, we use the `useAnimate` hook from [motion](https://motion.dev/docs/use-animate). This gives us a scope and an `animate` function to control the animation. We add `.letter-3d-swap-char-box-item` class name to each char box, so we can select and animate them with the `animate` function. After the animation is completed, we reset the transform to the original state.

<CodeSnippet title="Animation">
```tsx
// Animate each character with its specific delay
await animate(
  ".letter-3d-swap-char-box-item",
  { transform: rotationTransform },
  {
    ...transition,
    delay: (i: number) => delays[i],
  }

// Reset all boxes
await animate(
  ".letter-3d-swap-char-box-item",
  { transform: "rotateX(0deg) rotateY(0deg)" },
  { duration: 0 }
)
```
</CodeSnippet>

The transform is just a 90/-90 degree rotation either on the X or Y axis, depending on the `rotateDirection` prop.

### Stagger

The delay is calculated based on the `staggerFrom` prop, which can be set to `first`, `last`, `center`, `random` or a number. If it's a number, it's used as the index of the character to stagger from. For example, if `staggerFrom` is set to `2`, the second character will be staggered from the third one. We have a handy function to calculate the correct delay for each character:

<CodeSnippet title="Stagger delay calculation">
```tsx
// Helper function to calculate stagger delay for each text segment
const getStaggerDelay = useCallback(
  (index: number, totalChars: number) => {
    const total = totalChars
    if (staggerFrom === "first") return index * staggerDuration
    if (staggerFrom === "last") return (total - 1 - index) * staggerDuration
    if (staggerFrom === "center") {
      const center = Math.floor(total / 2)
      return Math.abs(center - index) * staggerDuration
    }
    if (staggerFrom === "random") {
      const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * total)
      return Math.abs(randomIndex - index) * staggerDuration
    }
    return Math.abs(staggerFrom - index) * staggerDuration
  },
  [staggerFrom, staggerDuration]
)
```
</CodeSnippet>
